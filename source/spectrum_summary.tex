    \color{green}\textbf{Advantages} \color{black} of the NRF technique
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model-independent
        \item High resolution
        \item (Selectivity)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \color{red}\textbf{Disadvantages}\color{black}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Nonresonant background
        \item Low cross section (long experiments, large samples, stable isotopes)
        \item Inefficient detection
