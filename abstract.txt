The Renaissance of the Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence Method

The study of atomic absorption spectra at the end of the 19th century led to the discovery of a multitude of chemical elements and helped to validate quantum mechanics.
Naturally, it was later proposed to use the resonant absorption of highly-energetic photons (gamma rays) to study atomic nuclei.
Some experimental obstacles had to be overcome first: only with the invention of artificial gamma-ray sources, capable of producing photons in large quantities, did the broad application of the nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) technique become possible.
Around the beginning of the 21st century, the advent of quasi-monoenergetic gamma-ray sources led to a revolution in nuclear spectroscopy similar to the one which took place in atomic physics with the development of lasers.

This talk will introduce the NRF method in the context of its history and its relation with atomic physics, discuss the advantages and disadvantages, and present two modern applications to fundamental research and technology.
